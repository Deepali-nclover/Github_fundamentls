    <h1>This is heading</h1>
    <p>By default HEAD points to the last commit, but if we go back to any of the previous states of the project, then HEAD will point to the relevant commit.
        $git show HEAD. 
        HEAD performs the same job as id of a commit can do. So we're able to use HEAD instead of id.
        But if we want to show up other commits using the HEAD. Eg .second commit
        $git show HEAD~1
        </p>
